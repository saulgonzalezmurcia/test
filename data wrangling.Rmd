```{r, loadLibraries}
# this library is to knit (export) your script as a PDF or html
library(knitr)
# this library contains the packages 'dplyr' and 'tidyr'
library(tidyverse)
```

## Basics

In order to upload data into R, you can use datasets from the following website, which contains tutorials, slides, etc.
```{r load datasets from html link}
# always load libraries in the beginning of a script to have access to all the codes in the following
load(url("http://www.flutterbys.com.au/stats/downloads/data/manipulationDatasets.RData"))
```

Use the project tool to keep scripts with codes and running analysis in each single project.

Install packages preferbly in R (open R as an admin) instead of RStudio to have maximum control of your packages, to have only one location for a package and to run updates properly.
Write 'sudo R' into the terminal and enter the password of ? then type install.packages('tidyverse')

```{r add chunks}
# chunk = Datenblock;
# add a chunk by clicking Insert and then R or by a shortcut: control = alt = i
# name your chunks to keep track!
# to run the codes in your chunks, remember to click on the green arrow = run current chunk
```
By typing '##' you can add a heading.

## Regular expressions

V1 = V2 : equals
V1 <- V2 : is assignes (zuweisen) or renames V1 to V2
== : if true / Is it equal to?
!= : false / Is it NOT equal to?
< : smaller than
> : bigger than
<= : smaller equals to
>= : bigger equals to
| : or

## Section {.tabset}

Add {.tabset} after 'section' to create tabs; only works in interactive media (html)
Type '###' and your title to create a new tab.

### GIT and GITHUB

GIT creates snapshots, called commits. After 30 days duplicational changes will get deleted. Newly configurate for each computer you use.

gitignore: ignores items on a list that you don't want to add to your repository.
data/* lets you choose an entire folder to exclude

Abbreviations:
-a 'name' : active (spacing after the letter neccessary)
-m 'name' : message

Use GitHub to share with collaborators and to manage your repository. Username is not changeable.
In R click on New Project and open Version Control

To jump back in time there are three comands:
checkout, which keeps your history and simply follows a new branch
reset, which is dangerous, since it deletes everything irreversibly
revert, which allows your to change the branch, but reverts the commits

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents, i.e. a language. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated as an rmd (RMarkDown) file that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can send it to others and embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
Click on R Markdown.

Basic functions are the following:
**name** = bold word
__name__ = underlined word
# = comment
-item 1 = list items
{name} = chunk name
<html link> = link html

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots (an equation), for example:

$$
\mu=2
$$



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
 $$
 y\sim{\beta_0 + \beta x}
 $$

### Data wrangling

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r wrangling}
# wrangling = Gerangel, Gezerre
```

```{r organise data}
# loads and displays your data
head(data.1)
# the function 'str' displays the structure of a dataframe
str(data.1)
# this function gives you a glimpse of your data
glimpse(data.1)
# fct are characters = variables
# int are intages = whole numbers
# dbl are doubles = decimals
```

```{r data wrangling}
# this library has to be implemented so that the function 'kable' runs
library(knitr)
# kable creates a table
# kable extra is able to change fonts, colors, etc. within the table
kable(data.1)
# a tibble called tbl_df is like a dataframe, fits data in the space available and shows what else is present that won't be able to get displayed in the current resolution
as.tibble(nasa)
# displaying the first two rows of your datasheet
head(data.1, 2)
# sorting data in order of the latitude (=LAT)
arrange(data.1,LAT)
# other way to sort data by latitude
data.1%>%arrange(LAT)
# same thing, but %>% combines sorting data AND producing a table, which is called piping
data.1 %>% arrange(LAT) %>% kable
# again same thing, but different way to type and track (nachvollziehen)
data.1 %>%
        arrange(LAT) %>%
        kable()
# if you put minus, then it sorts latitude from high to low; old function was desc = descending
data.1%>% arrange(-LAT) %>% kable
# here you sort first by condition and within that by temperature
arrange(data.1, Cond,Temp)
# sorts data by between and then condition
arrange(data.1, Between,Cond) %>%
# sorts first by condiditon and then by RATIO of Temp and latitude
# default sorts in alphabetical order
boxplot
arrange(data.1, Cond,Temp/LAT)
# to add or change a feature
mutate(data.1, ratio=Temp/LAT)
# same function as ahead
data.1 %>% mutate(ratio=Temp/LAT)
# to give names to abbreviations in the ORDER of how you put them!
data.1 %>% mutate(Cond=recode_factor(Cond, 'L'='Low', 'M'="Medium", 'H'='High'))
```
```{r slicing}
# the slice function relates to the order of the rows or colums. Thus, it isn't recommended to use.
```
```{r lag and lead}
#these functions swift values ahead of other values or after them
#used for biological implications, such as prey and predator relations
```



### Manipulating factors

```{r display variables}
# to display the conditions
data.1$Cond
# rename new datasheet
data.3<-data.1
# change the order of the factors in the conditions
data.3$Cond<- factor(data.3$Cond, levels=c('L','M','H'))
data.3$Cond
data.3 %>% arrange(Cond)
```

### Subset columns

```{r}
head(data.3, 2)
# to only select these variables
select(data.3, Between, Plot, Cond, Time, Temp)
# to exclude columns
select(data.3, -LAT,-LONG)
# to select variables that contain L and e
select(data.3, contains('L'), contains('e'))
# to choose a variable first and then the rest instead of writing all variables down
select(data.3, Temp, everything())

head(nasa)
# type %>% head after a function, which is too long, in order to avoid displaying the entire data sheet
select(nasa, lat, long, cloudhigh, cloudlow, cloudmid) %>% head
select(nasa, lat, long, starts_with('cloud')) %>% head
# tikus is the name of a dataset; choose from to with :
tikus[1:10,c(1:3,76,77)]
tikus %>% select('Pocillopora damicornis')
# args means argument
args(mean)
# rename variables
rename(data.3, Condition=Cond, Temperature=Temp)
# == means true means that if it's there, then include, if it's false, so not there, exclude it or if cond equals to H then include, so true
filter(data.3, Cond=='H')
# %in% means the variable includes two or more characters
# command shift m shortcut
filter(data.3, Cond %in% c('H', 'M'))
# & or comma can be used equally
filter(data.3, Cond=='H' & Temp<25)

head(data.3, 2)
# observe the difference of the outcome when using the function with or without brackets!
filter(data.3, Temp<20 & (LAT>20 | LONG<145))
filter(data.3, Temp<20 & LAT>20 | LONG<145)
# drop others levels that you didn't select when you filtered
data.3<-filter(data.1, Plot=='P1') %>% droplevels()

levels(data.3$Plot)
head(data.1, 2)
mutate(data.1, LL=LAT+LONG)
mutate(data.1, logTemp=log(Temp))
# add a row or column with chosen parameteres (vars) and what you want to do with it (funs log)
mutate_at(data.1, vars(Temp, LAT), funs(l=log)) %>% head()
# add a row or column if the data are numeric
mutate_if(data.1, is.numeric, funs(l=log, s=sqrt)) %>% head()

head(data.1, 2)
# sumarrise your data
summarise(data.1, MeanTemp=mean(Temp), VarTemp=var(Temp))
# how to create a function
# = and <- means the same here
SE = function(x) { sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))}
# cTemp means to center your temperature data, which means to substract the mean from the temperate to observe the difference (delta) from the mean for each value
# ?'name of the function', for instance
# ? kable is a function, which is used to look up a function in the help window
data.1 %>% group_by(Between, Plot) %>% mutate(Mean=mean(Temp), cTemp=Temp-Mean) %>%
        kable(caption='Summary table for Pocillopora damicornis')
```

### Reshaping data frames

```{r}
data.w
# 'gather' is used to change data to use for the analysis since the data are too big;
# there is a certain way to put data into an analysis
data.w %>% gather(key=Time, value=Count, Time.0:Time.2) %>% head
data.l=data.w %>% gather(key=Time, value=Count, Time.0:Time.2)
# 'spread' is the opposite function to 'gather' in order to display the data in a publication
data.l %>% spread(key=Time, value=Count)
```

### Merging data sets

```{r}
# missing values are excluded and residual values are merged when joining two datasheets
inner_join(data.bio, data.chem)
# merges all data, puts N/A for the missing values and displays them
full_join(data.bio, data.chem)
# includes the left datasheet (in this case data.bio) and includes them into the right datasheet (in this case data.chem)
left_join(data.bio, data.chem)
# does the same, but includes from the right to the left; you can also simply change the order of the datasheets
right_join(data.bio, data.chem)
```

### Mean cover of total Acropora abundance per year

```{r}
tikus %>% rename(`Acropora aspera`=`Acropera aspera`) %>% # correct typos
gather(key=Species, value=Abundance,-time,-rep) %>% # to sort data in a certain order to use them for analysis
mutate(Cover=Abundance/10) %>% # in order to convert abundance into cover divide by 10
separate(Species,c('Genera','Species')) %>% # 'separate function?
# sorts by groups for time, rep and genera
group_by(time,rep,Genera) %>% # group certain data
summarise(SumCover=sum(Cover)) %>% # summarise the cover data
group_by(time,Genera) %>%
summarise(Mean=mean(SumCover),
          Var=var(SumCover)) %>% 
# top_n sorts the top 3 genera by the mean
        top_n(3,Mean)
```
